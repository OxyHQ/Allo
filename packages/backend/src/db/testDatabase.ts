/**
 * A throwaway, fully-migrated Postgres database per suite run.
 *
 * `@oxyhq/db/testing` owns the create/drop mechanics, including the generated
 * name (`oxydb_test_<16 hex>`) and the pattern `dropTestDatabase` refuses to
 * drop outside of — which is what stops a stray connection string turning
 * teardown into `DROP DATABASE allo`.
 *
 * ## Why the migration shells out instead of calling `runMigrations` in-process
 *
 * `createTestDatabase` takes `migrate` as a callback precisely so a caller can
 * pass `(url) => runMigrations({ … })`, and that would be one fewer moving part.
 * It is deliberately not what happens here.
 *
 * A second, in-test composition of `runMigrations` is a second set of options —
 * its own migrations folder, its own extension list, its own phase — free to
 * drift from `src/db/migrate.ts` with nothing to notice. The drift is invisible
 * in exactly the direction that matters: the suite keeps passing against a
 * correctly migrated database while the script an operator actually runs is
 * broken. Shelling out to the real entrypoint means the harness exercises the
 * same argument parsing, the same `--target-database` guard and the same phase
 * enforcement that dev and production get.
 *
 * `--phase=all` because a throwaway database has no previous image to protect:
 * the pre/post split exists to sequence a rollout, and there is no rollout here.
 *
 * The subprocess runs through `ts-node --transpile-only`, which is how this
 * package runs TypeScript everywhere else (`npm start`, `npm run dev`). Using a
 * different runner here would mean the suite migrates through a toolchain no
 * operator ever uses.
